Nowadays, people want to easily know their health or mental state. 
So, our team has created an application that classifies the user's condition based on the user's breath and recommends supplementary points.
we used firebase which stores application data and google colab which analysis and classify user's state. 


Deep learning model which classifies using multi-perceptron model.
This model is built using data measured in five different modes which are 
Normal, physical stress, mental stress, relaxed, and deep-breath modes.
Mfcc, Chroma, Mel, Contrast and tonnez are used to analysis audio features. 
This deep learnig model learned from this data and classifies user's current condition.
